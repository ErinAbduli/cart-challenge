# Product Cart Challenge

This weeks challenge (24/05/2024) is a simple one.

We have 2 classes and an enum. One is used for creating an object, other other is for interacting with a cart.
We also have an enum to make sure we have some unique way to identify different products.

This challenge has bugs, bad code practices and lacks any tests.

## How to take part
1. First steps add your [SSH Key to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), this will make this a lot easier
2. Fork the repository
3. Using `git clone` on you fork of the repository
4. Make sure to create your own branch (`git checkout -b branchName`) with your username and the word solution, such as `git checkout -b ethans-solution`
5. Write your code, add some tests, even add some comments to your code to explain what you're doing if you'd like
6. Now push your changes up, via `git push -u origin master` this will push to master and set your upstream. You will see a link in your terminal, this will allow you to create a Pull Request.
7. Then wait for review :)

### Winner Criteria
The winner will be chosen based of these criteria

- The cleanest code
- Good amount of tests added, with a bunch of scenarios tested

### Final Steps
